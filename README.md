## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 5. <br>
The objective of this exercise is to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, using two third party APIs: JQuery and Moment.js. The website basic structure was written in HTML. Javascript is used to created the list of tasks and evaluate each task against the current time of the day. The tasks are saved to local storage when the user clicks the lock button.
